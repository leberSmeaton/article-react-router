# Tech Article App

A Codecademy code-a-long app to help my understanding of the React Router. It is basic blog for tech articles allowing the user to browser articles, search and read them in their entirety. It has a sign in/up authorisation which defaults to the sign in page when the user logs out.

This project allowed me to work with the following features.

- react-router-dom,
- BrowserRouter and wrapping the app contents within this component, to which...
- I then moved it to the more concise Router.
- Route component.
- Applied Route props to help define static and dynamic routes.
- Redirected users with the Redirect component.
- Applied hooks such as useParams, useHistory, useLocation.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
